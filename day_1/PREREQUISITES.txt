Hi,

Welcome to my Python class.

Here are some materials you need to download and get ready
for our first meeting, which involves a lot of setup and configuration.
I have provided links to the websites where you can get them for FREE.
Please, do not install 2 and 3 until we meet in class.


1. Zoom (for Desktop): if you don't already have one installed
on your computer, you may download and install one from
this link: https://zoom.us/download

2. Python IDLE. Download Python version 3.10.1
(https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. VSCode: follow the link and download VSCode.
